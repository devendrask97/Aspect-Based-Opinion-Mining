# Aspect-Based-Opinion-Mining
This project focuses on aspect-level opinion mining (explicit aspects) and incorporates syntactic unsupervised approach for it. It is used to extract most important aspects of the product along with the opinion words describing that aspect. The sheer volume of online reviews makes it difficult for a human to process and extract all meaningful information in order to make an educated decision. We do not require any seed word or domain-specific knowledge of the product. The result of the project shows the extracted aspects from the reviews, various opinion words describing that aspect and its rating. The rating of aspects are given with the help of sentiment scores calcualted using the lexical resource, SentiWordNet. The review dataset is collected from various ecommerce websites.
